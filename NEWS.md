## Version 5.06 - 01/02/2024

- Moved management to GitHub for the code.

## Version 5.05 - 12/28/2023

- Cleanups for R2023b.
- Critically, `strip.m` renamed to `stripmain.m` because `strip` has become reserved word - source of lots of user problems.
- Also removed the waitbar from analysis, seemed to cause more problems and hung windows, possibly related to `strip.m `issue but removed.
- Some functionality removed: `holehelper()`, `abaqus_me()`, and MASTAN in/out. Will separate into their own tools, or bring back in the future version.
- Changed CUTWP to use global variables instead of load and save, this should now work in compiled versions bringing back this functionality to those users.
